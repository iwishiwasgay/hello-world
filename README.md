# hello-world
```perl
# how do i say hello if there are only 7 million people in the world?

# printfs("Hello, world");

# OR

# puts("Hello, world");

# legit

#! /usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

print "Hello, world\n";

# why strict and warnings for hello world?
# why not?
```

# Apparently, introductions go here.

I'm a guy who does some things. Don't worry about who I do them for. Interested in Android Kernel Development because I want to have a kernel focused around being adaptive in order to provide the smoothest experience. Blah blah, buzzwords.
